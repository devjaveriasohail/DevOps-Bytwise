# Day 12: Intermediate Python Concepts for Automation

## Functions and Modules

### Tasks 
- Defined a function to calculate factorial of a number and tested it with different inputs.
- Created a module containing functions for basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Tasks
- Modified an existing script to handle exceptions gracefully (e.g., file not found, division by zero).
- Debugged a script using `pdb` or an IDE to identify and fix logical errors.

##  Networking and APIs

### Tasks Completed:
- Implemented a script to make HTTP GET requests using Python's `requests` library.
- Created a script to interact with a mock REST API (e.g., fetch data, update records).
