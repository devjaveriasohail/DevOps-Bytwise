## Introduction - Day 1

This is the day I have to start the challenge #90DaysOfDevOps

- Start with a DevOps Roadmap[https://youtu.be/0yWAtQ6wYNM?si=JasHQb1ExXqEI1Op]
- Write a LinkedIn post or a small article about your understanding of DevOps
- Read the detail article on medium [https://medium.com/@javeriasohail996/what-and-why-of-devops-5677dc47db18]
- What is DevOps?
  DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.
- What are Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?
Automation is the procedure for improving DevOps by automating and optimizing processes through technology. It may be used for the design and development, software deployment and release, monitoring stages and so on. The main purpose of DevOps (development operations) automation is to make the whole lifecycle easier by cutting down on manual work.
Scaling is an advantage of automation. Automated processes are much easier to scale than manual processes. Scaling refers to the ability to increase or decrease the capacity of your IT resources to meet changing demands.
Infrastructure in IT refers to the physical and virtual resources that support the flow, storage, processing, and analysis of data. This includes servers, storage, networking, and software. In DevOps, infrastructure is often managed as code (IaC), allowing teams to define, provision, and manage infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware setups
- Why is DevOps important?
DevOps is important because it addresses several critical challenges in software development and IT operations, such as Faster Time to Market, Improved Quality and Reliability, Enhanced Collaboration and Communication, Scalability and Flexibility, Increased Security
